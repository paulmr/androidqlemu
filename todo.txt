BUG - move to home screen while ql screen is displaying,
when you come back it crashes (is thread trying to update
screen after components have gone?)

TODO - support mode 8 in the ql screen

TODO - add display reg support so you can change display mode

TODO - support full boot up

TODO - interrupts?

TODO - keyboard input. Is shoving into the keyboard queue sufficient?
